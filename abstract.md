Drug discovery presents one of the greatest search problems in the computational sciences.  For exclusively small organic molecules, there is an estimated $10^{60}$ possible molecules.  Navigating this search space is difficult, but machine learning techniques have been demonstrated to have significant predictive power when inferring the properties and activities of small-molecule compounds.  Yet, current techniques have minimal applicability due to the requirement of large datasets and only $10^{-52}$ of the search space having available data.  One-shot learning is a powerful approach for generating meaningful predictions in light of limited data.  Despite this technique seeing significant progress in computer vision and natural language processing applications, it has been scarcely applied in the drug discovery space.  In this study, we will be adapting recent results with graph-convolutional architectures, which can process small-molecules as undirected graphs and build up features using learnable convolution layers.  We will mathematically adapt standard one-shot learning protocols to the drug discovery problem.  Several datasets will be used for training and testing, namely the Tox21 collection consisting of 12 nuclear receptor assays, the SIDER data set containing information on marketed medicines and their observed adverse reactions, and the MUV data set collection containing 17 assays designed to be challenging for standard virtual screening.  Our learning challenge is to learn to predict experimental outcomes for new compounds being active in the same systems as the support set.  Similarly, we would like to infer unknown assay results based on the results of similar compounds in similar assays.
