This text file will contain journal entries for the project I am pursuing in my Probabalistic Modeling course at 
Princeton University.  The format will be rather informal, and I will be making weekly entries (at the very least).

The abstract is due today.  I wrote an initial version last night, but I feel that improvements can be made. In
the past few days, I have read several papers on few-shot/one-shot learning (FSL/OSL). I am certain that I would 
like to do a project related to drug discovery, since research there is scarce for FSL/OSL.  Many exciting FSL/OSL 
methods have emerged in the past few years but they have not really be applied to drug discovery.  This creates 
novelty in my project: adapting a state-of-the-art OSL/FSL method to perform drug discovery.  I need to 1) settle
on a method to adapt, and 2) settle on datasets to work with.  Hopefully, I can continue to read papers and have
these two items set in stone.  My abstract, as it stands, contains a general idea of methods/datasets but I am
uncertain as to whether or not I will stick to my currently written direction.
